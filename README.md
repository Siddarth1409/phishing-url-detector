#  Phishing URL Detector Web App

A machine learning-powered web application that detects whether a given URL is legitimate or a phishing attempt.
Built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, this tool provides a simple web interface and keeps a log of all URL predictions.

---

##  Features

-  Detect if a URL is phishing or safe using a trained ML model
-  Logs all prediction results with date & time to `history.csv`
-  View past predictions in a user-friendly table
-  Built with Flask and trained using scikit-learnâ€™s Random Forest

---

##  Machine Learning Details

- **Model**: RandomForestClassifier  
- **Training script**: `train_model.py`  
- **Dataset**: URLs labeled as phishing or legitimate (`dataset.csv`)  
- **Features extracted** (from `features.py`):
  - Length of URL
  - Presence of `@`, `//`, `-`
  - Count of dots, hyphens
  - Use of HTTPS
  - Domain properties, etc.

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Flask (for web app)
- Pandas & scikit-learn (for model)
- HTML + Bootstrap (for frontend)
- CSV (for logging)
